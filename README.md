AngularJS Presentation
======================
Materials to support a 15-20 minute talk
covering the basics of AngularJS. Markdown
files at the root are presentation notes.
[Gollum](http://github.com/github/gollum) is
used to serve the Wiki. The rest of the files
are for the demo app. Tags are available to
quickly switch to commits that introduce
demonstrable new functionality in the demo app.
