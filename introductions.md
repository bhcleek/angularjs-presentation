# Me #
I'm Billie Cleek. I've been a professional software developer since 1998, and I have a passion for tools and processes that drive the discipline and art of software development forward.

I've spent the better part of the last 3 years doing a lot of web application development, and like a lot of others, my competence with JavaScript has grown exponentially in that time. I started using AngularJS in October 2012 and my current project at work is/will making heavy use of AngularJS and Node.js

# AngularJS #
AngularJS is one of the latest frameworks to come out. Riding fast on the heels of Prototype, SugarJS, Underscore, and jQuery, a new generation of tooling is rising. Knockout, Backbone.js, Ember, and AngularJS each provide a framework for building client-side applications.

AngularJS uses HTML as the view template, letting the browser be the view engine.
